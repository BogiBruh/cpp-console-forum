# cpp-console-forum

This is a project for a C++ course im doing, its a forum running in a console with basic and improvised data storage in a .txt file.

## What does it do
So far all instructions are in serbian.
At the start of the program it checks if the "database file" exists, and if it doesnt it asks you whether to create it.
So far it only displays the posts made by hand by me for testing.

## What will be added
- rework to the loading algorithm for replies. For now it only lists direct replies, and it needs to also support replies to replies
- a function to create your own posts & replies
- creating/deleting(?) accounts

After the project is done and submitted i will reformat the code as it is currently as spaghetti as possible, and i dont see a way to improve it yet. However i see it being possible.
Also adding a way for other people to connect and use it over IP too.
