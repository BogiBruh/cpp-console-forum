# cpp-console-forum

This is a project for a C++ course im doing, its a forum running in a console with basic and improvised data storage in a .txt file.

## What does it do
So far all instructions are in serbian.
At the start of the program it checks if the "database file" exists, and if it doesnt it asks you whether to create it.
So far it only displays the posts made by hand by me for testing, and you can also post and delete stuff. 

## What will be added in the future
- creating/deleting accounts,
- multiplayer functionality

## Downloading
You can download the executable in the releases section, or you can click the green button right above the file list and download the zipped source code and stare in awe at how much spaghetti i cooked! Its wonderful, tasty and frankly absolutely indubitably DISGUSTING TO LOOK AT!

The project is done and submitted so i will probably fix after a few years. Or completely rework it. Who knows? I sure dont.
